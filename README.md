# EA-LSTM

It is pytorch and keras implementations of [**EA-LSTM: Evolutionary Attention-based LSTM for Time Series Prediction**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03760).

## _Train and test_
- You can simply run code by
```
$ python main.py --data pollution.csv
```

## _Discussion_
- With my implementations, I failed to reproduce the results provided in the paper for PM2.5 dataset. if there's mistake or you have comment, please let me know to improve the code.

## _Reference_
For keras implementation, I refer to [author's original code](https://github.com/LiYouru0228/EA-LSTM)
